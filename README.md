**React Native Test App :)**

#### Using React Native, build an app that:

- [ ] Connects to the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/)
- [ ] Obtains photos from the 'Mars Rover' endpoint
- [ ] Allows the user to see the photos of each rover (Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit)
- [x] The photos list should be paginated showing a max of 25 photos per page (dynamic loading similar to facebook/instagram will be nice, not required)
- [ ] Allows the user to filter the rover photos by camera
- [ ] default it shows the latest photos for current d
- [ ] lows the user to search for photos based on 'Earth Day' date (2020-09-2
- [ ] lows the user to search for photos based on the 'Sol' date (289

`Optional:`

- Allow the user to save search parameters in Local Storage
- A lot of extra points if you include a few tests.
- We don't care about the UX design, but a nicely styled app would get extra points :D

Notes:

- [x] You can use ~~Expo~~ or CLI
- [x] You can use Redux but we prefer Context
- [x] We will check for coding style and consistency mostly, we are interested in seeing how you think and organize a project.
- [x] Please use a linter!
- [x] When you finish the test, push it as a public repository in github, gitlab, bitbucket or similar and send us the repository URL.

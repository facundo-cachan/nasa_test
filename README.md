**React Native Test App :)**

#### Using React Native, build an app that:

- ˜˜ Connects to the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/) ˜˜
- ˜˜ Obtains photos from the 'Mars Rover' endpoint ˜˜
- ˜˜ Allows the user to see the photos of each rover (Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit) ˜˜
- The photos list should be paginated showing a max of 25 photos per page (dynamic loading similar to facebook/instagram will be nice, but not required)
- Allows the user to filter the rover photos by camera
- By default it shows the latest photos for current day
- Allows the user to search for photos based on 'Earth Day' date (2020-09-22)
- Allows the user to search for photos based on the 'Sol' date (2890)

`Optional:`

- Allow the user to save search parameters in Local Storage
- A lot of extra points if you include a few tests.
- We don't care about the UX design, but a nicely styled app would get extra points :D

Notes:

- You can use Expo or CLI
- You can use Redux but we prefer Context
- We will check for coding style and consistency mostly, we are interested in seeing how you think and organize a project.
- Please use a linter!
- When you finish the test, push it as a public repository in github, gitlab, bitbucket or similar and send us the repository URL.
